							<h2> Yoga Lover </h2>
							<p> * The yoga allows us to be who we really are, it allows us to expose our truth. </p>
<p> * It really help bring about your fullest potential but in the end it is we who must take the final step. Freedom to move and express yourself in a manner which is most natural to your body.</p>
<p> * Yoga allows us to express the movement, noise, tempo that you chose, maybe one step further and, sometimes but not always, one step back. When you have found your truth, be your truth.</p>
